Question:1
     Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Answer:
     1.HTTP2 is binary, where as HTTP1 is textual.
     2.HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and           blocking.
     3.HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for               parallelism.
     4.HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead.
     5.HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively         into client caches.
     6.HTTP2 is secured by default.


Question:2
    HISTORY OF HTTP
Answer:
    HTTP/0.9
    1.Year of release 1991.
    2.It is extremely simple requests consist of a single          line and start with the only possible method GET             followed by the path to the resource.
    3.There were no status or error messages.
    HTTP/1.0
    1.Year of release is 1996
    2.Version information is now sent within each request.
    3.A status code is also sent at the beginning of the           response.
    4.The HTTP headers has been introduced.
    5.The transfer of other documents than plain HTML files        has been added.
    HTTP/1.1
    1.Year of release is 1997
    2.A connection can be reused.
    3.Pipelining has been added, allowing to send a second         request before the answer for the first one is fully         transmitted.
    4.Cache control mechanism have been introduced.
    HTTP/2
    1.Year of release is 2015
    2.It is a binary protocol rather than text.
    3.It is a multiplexed protocol. Parallel requests can be       handled over the same connection, removing the order         and blocking issues of the HTTTP/1.1 protocol.
    4.It compresses headers. As these are often similar            among a set of requests, this removes duplication and        overhead of data transmitted.


Question:3
    Difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs
Answer:
    1.In browser “window” is a predefined global object            which has functions and attributes, where as Nodejs          doesn’t have it.
    2.In browser “location” is another predefined object,          where as Nodejs doesn’t have it.
    3.In browser “require” is not predefined object, where         as Nodejs has it.
    4.In browser module is not required, where as in Nodejs        you have to keep your code inside the module.
    5.In browser “document” is a predefined object, where as       Nodejs doesn’t have it.

Question:4
    what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in       the browser
Answer:
    1.The browser looks up the IP address for the domain           name via DNS.
    2.The browser sends a HTTP request to the server.
    3.The server sends back a HTTP response.
    4.The browser begins rendering the HTML.
    5.The browser sends requests for additional objects            embedded in HTML (images, CSS, JavaScript) 
    6.Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further           requests as needed.
